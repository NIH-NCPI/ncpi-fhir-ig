In this example, we provide a single "row" of data as an Observation. The row's subject references the relevant Patient resource while the specimen resource references the the relevant Specimen resource (most, if not all rows, should provide a reference to the subject, but the specimen may only apply to rows from specific tables.) 

Notice the use of codes from the study's data-dictionary code systems. For the Observation's code, we use the study's entry, [demographics](CodeSystem-example-study-dd-dataset-codesystem-1.html) from the dataset code system. For each of the variables, represented here as elements in the component array, the codes used are from the related variable's entry in the table's [CodeSystem](CodeSystem-example-study-dd-datatable-codesystem-1.html).
