This example shows the use of the StudyDataDictionaryTable to aggregate each of the table's variables into a single resource. The *url* property must be unique for the entire server, and as such, acts as an identifier. The topic is set to [Research](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/umls) and the code is set to [demographics](CodeSystem-example-study-data-dictionary-dataset-codesystem-1.html) which is the table's Code entry from the dataset CodeSystem. Finally, each of the Variables are referenced in the list, observationResultRequirement.
