### Research Study Summaries

#### Overview
This module describes the tools used for a public representation of a Research Study, including optional content and study summary data (corresponding to existing dbGaP data dictionaries and variable summary reports).

#### ResearchStudy
NCPI uses the ResearchStudy resource to share data about Research Studies themselves. In the NCPI setting, these resources are focused on retrieving information about the study and data from the study and not on operating a research study. Additionally, weâ€™ve acknowledged some of the weaknesses of the R4 ResearchStudy and have included some extensions that map to the R5 version.
