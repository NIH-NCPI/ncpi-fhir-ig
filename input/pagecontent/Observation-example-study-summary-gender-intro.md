The following study variable summary highlights the basic format one can expect when producing as well as consuming these summaries. The code is set to a common code, C0242482 which indicates that the Observation is a Summary Report. The subject property is set the the population from which the summary data was collected, in this case the [Entire Study Population](Group-example-summary-group-1.html). The Focus references the [study itself](ResearchStudy-ncpi-research-study-01.html). For the value[X] portion of the resource, we have described the source of the summary data which happens to be the "gender" code from the [demographics-table](CodeSystem-example-study-dd-datatable-codesystem-1.html) along with a harmonized coding mapping that variable to the UMLS code for "Gender", C0079399.

Finally, we have the summary data listed as components. 

These are enumerated alongside a corresponding code which indicates what the summary component is about. In this particular case, it's codes for male and female from [administrative gender](http://hl7.org/fhir/administrative-gender) and for missing, which is coded as the UMLS code, "C1705492", "Missing".
