With regard to this Implementation Guide, a research study is an organized collection of data used by researchers to further the understanding of human health, genetics, drug response, etc. A single study can be comprised of multiple smaller sub-studies or be a single unit. The study will likely be hosted in a public database such as dbGaP and will be associated with citations in scientific journals. The study itself may be a part of a large organization of researcher studies, such as a consortium. 

To discuss the way in which a *Research Study* is represented in FHIR, we must first establish what it is that is being discussed. To do this, we have created a "Common Data Model" that represents the study at a high level and represent it using FHIR's logical model.
