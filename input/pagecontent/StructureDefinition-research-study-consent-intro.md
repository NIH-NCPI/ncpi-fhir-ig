The ResearchStudyConsent profile is designed to conform to the same guidelines as found in the DbGaP/NIH Consent model. In this model, the consent's category contains an array of codes for each of the restrictions specified in the given consent. For instance, [HMB-NPU Consent](consent-hmb-npu-consent.html), there would be two codes added to the provision's purpose property: One for the HBM restriction and one for the NPU. Those restrictions must be selected from the CodeSystem, [NIH Consent](codesystem-nih-consent.html). For more disease specific restrictions, the code _DS_ is to be used along with a corresponding disease code(s) added via the[Research Consent Disease Restrictions](structuredefinition-research-consent-disease-restrictions.html). 

Each ResearchStudyConsent resource is intended to be a singular resource that is used by all participants that were enrolled into the study under the particular consent agreement. As such, the model differs somewhat from the R4 Consent model. In this model, for each distinct consent agreement present in the study will be represented by a (ResearchStudySubject)(StructureDefinition-research-study-subject.html) which contains a single [Study Group](StructureDefinition-study-group.html) that may contain references to each participant consented by the relevant agreement. This ResearchStudySubject will contain a reference to the corresponding ResearchStudyConsent resource via the [Research Study Subject Consent](StructureDefinition-research-study-subject-consent.html).
