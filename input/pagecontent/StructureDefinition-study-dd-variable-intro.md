### Study Variables

A study variable should describe, as completely as possible, the content associated with the data in it's original form, including details about units, ranges, etc. 
It is important to associate each variable with an entry from the table's CodeSystem so that data that is related to variable be traceable regardless of it's final form (i.e. you can't point back to an ObservationDefinition from a Condition resource, however, you can append the ObservationDefinition's code to the Condition's code.)
