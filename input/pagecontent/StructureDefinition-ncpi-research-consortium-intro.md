### Key Guidelines
For those studies which are a part of a research consortium, a single NCPI Research Consortium resource should be used to represent the consortium and all related studies should point to the consortium using the **sponsor** property. 

#### Added Profile Restrictions
Each Consortium __must__ have:
* a **meaningful name**. 
 

#### Recommended Practice
* **common IDs** and **acronyms** be provided as **aliases**. 
* The **telecom** property can be used to provide a URL pointing to the consortium's website.
