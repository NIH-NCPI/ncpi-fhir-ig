### Scope and Usage
The Phenotype profile is used to associate a patient with one or more phenotypic observations. These observations can be either present or absent and will likely have an age associated with when the phenotype was observed. 

The primary code system employed by this profile is [Human Phenotype Ontology](http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org).
