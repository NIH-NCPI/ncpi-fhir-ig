Capturing tabular data in FHIR is useful for data that has been transformed to meet the interoperable FHIR model as well as data that either doesn't fit the current model or simply can't be transformed at this time due to a lack of available effort to perform the transformations necessary. In these examples, the variables will have been transformed to meet the interoperable model but the representation would be the same even if the that wasn't the case.
