This data does not reveal details about any particular subject, and as such can be hosted on public FHIR server regardless of the restrictions put into place on the source data from which it was derived. By tying the valueCodeableConcept to public ontologies, the data becomes more easily discovered. Finally, if the values being enumerated are not common terms, like the ones shown above, if those too rest side-by-side with public terms, the data is far more easily interpreted by other researchers.
