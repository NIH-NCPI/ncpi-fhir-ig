Based on the [NCPI Research Study](StructureDefinition-ncpi-research-study.html) profile, this resource **must** have a _partOf_ property which points to the main NcpiResearchStudy resource. It **should** also use the [Research Study Subject Consent extension](StructureDefinition-research-study-subject-consent.html) to point to the corresponding consent resource. 

Because it is derived from the NCPI Research Study profile, the resource's enrollment must contain a single [Study Group](StructureDefinition-study-group.html).
