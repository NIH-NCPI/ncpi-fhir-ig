#### Code Must be Present
While there may be more than one coding associated with these Observations, one of them _must_ be the code from the Table's data-dictionary entry in the data-set CodeSystem. This provides basic context associated with what the contents of the resource relate to. 

#### Components Represent the Row's Columns
Each of these Observations represents a single row from a single table from the study's dataset. The individual cells are captured as components such that each non-missing data point will be stored in a separate component. 

There _must_ be at least one component present.
