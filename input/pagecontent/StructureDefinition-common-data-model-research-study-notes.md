### Identifiers (Accession IDs, Acronyms, etc)
Identifiers serve to allow researchers to identify exactly which study is being described. This includes Accession Numbers for studies where the data has been submitted to a public database such as dbGaP.

The identifiers may include: 
* dbGaP 
* Acronyms

For the purposes of this *model*, we'll refer to all of these as *accession* ids.
