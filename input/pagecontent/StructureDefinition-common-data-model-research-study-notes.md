### Identifiers (Accession IDs, Acronyms, etc)
For those studies where the data has been submitted to a public database such as dbGaP, there will be a formal identifier such as an Accession Number assigned to it. This is identifier will be important for other researchers to easily identify exactly which study is being described. 

Other ids too are important, such as those IDs that are used to differentiate the study from it's consortium peer studies. 

For the purposes of this *model*, we'll refer to all of these as *accession* ids. 

### Name and description
Each study will have a name as well as a detailed description. 

### Attribution, Weblinks, citation and study documents

### Study Design and Study Type

### Study Focus
Studies will have one or more focus which may be either a disease or a phenotype.

### Studies may be comprised of substudies
These sub-studies may be related to data-use restrictions such as how participants were consented or the types of data that were captured for study. 

### Organizational Membership
A study may be a member of an organization, such as a consortium.
